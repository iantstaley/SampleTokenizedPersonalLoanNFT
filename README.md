# SampleTokenizedPersonalLoanNFT
An example implementation of a Solidity smart contract for tokenizing a personal loan via an NFT.
This contract inherits from OpenZeppelin's ERC721 and Ownable contracts to implement a non-fungible token and an owner-controlled access model, respectively. The PersonalLoanNFT contract defines a Loan struct that stores the loan's amount, interest rate, and duration.
The mint function allows the contract owner to create new loan tokens by specifying the loan details and the recipient's address. The function returns the newly created token ID. The _loanDetails mapping is used to store the loan details associated with each token ID.
The getLoanDetails function allows anyone to retrieve the loan details associated with a given token ID.
Note that this implementation is just an example, and you may need to customize it based on your specific requirements. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the contract is thoroughly tested and audited before being deployed to a production environment.
